# Object-builder-for-OpenGL
Imports models from model designers into OpenGL
Text file puska.obj contains information about the layout of vertecies and triangles of the model.
That data  s loaded into OpenGl which otherwise isnt able to import objects created in other software.
The goal of the project is to speed up the process of creating object in opengl
